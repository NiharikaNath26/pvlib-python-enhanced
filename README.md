# Final Enhanced Codebase for pvlib-python

This version includes the implementation of all 3 selected prompts:

1. Modularization of `pvsystem.py` into `module.py`, `inverter.py`, and `temperature.py`
2. A command-line interface (`pvlib_cli.py`) for single PV simulations
3. A parallel batch runner (`pvlib/batch_runner.py`) using multiprocessing

All changes follow the original code patterns and integrate cleanly.
